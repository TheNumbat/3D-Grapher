Priority:
	FIX BUGS
	animations
	vector fields

Bugs
	clamp x/y bounds correctly when the function doesn't exist in part of the domain
	one strip of polygons is too dark
	cylindrical graph doesn't have correct bounds??

Camera
	lock to rotate about axis

Graphs
	animation
		settings changes
		level curves
		evolution over time (4D)	

	Highlight graph intersections
	More graph types (see enum)

	Line/Surface/Flux integrals
	E Regions
	Tangent Planes

Change Log
- added 1st/2nd/3rd partials in both variables
- UI : snap camera to see XY/XZ/YZ plane
- color based on gradient/surface normal
- level curves on graph in x/y/z
- MSAA
- [fix] fixed incorrect generation of triangles for unmatched z/theta resolutions in cylindrical graphs
