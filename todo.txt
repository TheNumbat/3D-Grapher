Rendering
	animate through settings / equation changes

Camera
	Set to rotate about axis

Bugs
	clamp x/y bounds correctly when the function doesn't exist in part of the domain
	one strip of polygons is too dark
	cylindrical graph doesn't have correct bounds??

Math Features
	Level curves + animate
	Highlight curve along a set x/y
	Highlight graph intersections

	More graph types (see enum)
	Plot evolution of 3D graph over time (4D) (animated)

	Line/Surface/Flux integrals
	E Regions
	Tangent Planes

Change Log
- added 1st/2nd/3rd partials in both variables
- UI : snap camera to see XY/XZ/YZ plane
- color based on gradient/surface normal
- level curves on graph in x/y/z
- MSAA
- [fix] fixed incorrect generation of triangles for unmatched z/theta resolutions in cylindrical graphs
